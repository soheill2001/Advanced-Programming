# Mini Golf Game
## Description
Mini Golf is a game developed using C++ and SDL2 library. In this game, you control a ball and try to complete each hole with as few strokes as possible. The game features three different types of terrain: water, sand, and grass, which have different friction coefficients that affect the ball's speed. If the ball falls into the water, the game is over.

The game also includes three types of walls: fixed walls, moving walls, and fatal walls. Fixed and moving walls will simply deflect the ball's trajectory, while fatal walls will cause the game to end immediately if the ball hits them.

## How to Play
To play the game, use your mouse to click on the ball and drag it in the direction you want it to go. The longer you drag the ball, the greater the speed of the shot. Release the mouse button to take the shot.
You can change the position of the game elements (e.g. walls, target area) by editing a text file called `in.txt`.
